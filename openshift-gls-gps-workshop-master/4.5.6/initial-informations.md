## Initial Informations for the Openshift 4 Workshop

- In our workshop documents we use at some points placeholders for various reasons. when you start the workshop you will be assigned to an hypervisor machine by your instructor, e.g h1.rhaw.io, h2.rhaw.io etc.

- You need to take this hypervisor number and replace everywhere in the documents the character hX with for example h2 or h3 etc. when you execute the commands on your bastion or hypervisor node or when you use the openshift cli.

- This is very important, because if you missed that, parts of the workshop steps will not work as expected.

- Sometimes output and code snippets could vary between document and your installation, when it is about pathes output naming etc. This is related because this document is written in general and not for each installation.  We expect that you as an OpenShift Expert can handle this differences.

- Furthermore in this workshop we will not explain in depth architecure and theory of kubernetes and openshift. we expect, that you already attend the redhat courses: DO180, DO280 and maybe DO380.  Furthermore we expect an RCSA or similar skill before joining this workshop.
